## Overview
Every year the US Census Bureau collects data on America's people, places and economy. This data is critical in depicting an accurate portrait of America. This project utilizes the [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html) package to import data from the US Census Bureauâ€™s API. 
The data is then visualized inside an R shiny application.
